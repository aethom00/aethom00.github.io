                            <p>Assembly Linker</p>
                            <p>The Linker project involves developing a linker for combining assembly object files into a unified executable. The linker takes 1 to 6 object files, concatenates their text and data segments, placing text before data, and adjusts symbolic addresses in the relocation table. The execution starts from the main file provided first. The special global label "Stack" manages the stack, automatically resolved beyond segments. Error checking includes detecting duplicate global labels, undefined labels, and object files defining the stack label. Handling local labels during linking involves storing file data and adjusting addresses. The program runs through a command-line interface, linking 2 to 6 object files to generate a machine code file.</p>

                            <p>This behavioral simulator project involves creating a program to simulate any assembly machine-code program. The simulator reads a machine-code file generated by an assembler, initializes registers and the program counter to 0, and executes the program until a halt instruction is encountered. The simulator parses machine code, extracts opcode and arguments, and executes instructions accordingly. The simulator handles offsetFields for lw, sw, and beq carefully, considering 2's complement 16-bit numbers.</p>

                            <p>This project involves creating an online banking infrastructure simulator. The program parses input files, including a user registration file and command file containing operations and queries. It handles user commands such as login, logout, and transaction placement, ensuring validity and detecting potential fraudulent activities. Transactions are executed based on a priority queue and checked for factors like timestamps, user existence, and active sessions. Transaction fees are calculated with loyalty discounts. Queries include listing transactions, calculating bank revenue, summarizing customer history, and daily summaries. The program performs error handling, prints output to standard output, and follows specified command line options via getopt_long().</p>

                            <p>This project involves designing and simulating a CPU cache integrated into an assembly behavioral simulator. The cache is flexible, accommodating various configurations like write-back, allocate-on-write policies, associativity ranging from direct-mapped to fully associative to set associative, and specific size and block size parameters. Detailed instructions guide the modification process, and the compiled executable is run with specified command-line arguments.</p>

                            <p>Using the programming language C++ I used Object Oriented Programming to create an accurate representation of the famed Michigan card game Euchre using inheritance, polymorphism, and advanced data structures. The game is customizable in the number of players vs the number of computers that play against you. The computer players' moves are based off of a pre-determined algorithm to attempt to beat the opposing team.</p>

                            <p>The project guesses a location given a panorama generated from an API. The Geoguessr AI plays a game similar to the infamous game Geoguessr, a game that shows players a photo of a location and have the player guess the location. The random panoramas from <a href="https://www.mapillary.com/app/" target="_blank">Mapillary</a> is converted into grayscale, then its pixels are used to create a model of trained data using Keras from the Tensorflow Python library. Now after training the Geoguessr AI is able to make a prediction given its trained data predict the location of the panorama. The output of the program is one or many shaded boxes depending on its confidence, the box shaded the most is the guess of the AI and the blue dot shown below is the actual location. The program ends up being quite accurate at a correct prediction rate of 90%.</p>

                            <p>In this project I developed a program that uses a seam carving algorithm to resize photos any png photo you give as an input. The seam carving algorithm works by calculating which pixels are the most important to the photo and deleting the amount of pixels you're downsizing by that are the least important to the photo. You can find similar software on applications such as Adobe Photoshop or simply your phone's built-in photo editing software.</p>

                            <p>The Assembler project involves creating an assembler that translates assembly language into machine code and supports external references. It addresses issues with undefined references by allowing for global symbolic addresses, distinguishing between local and global labels. The assembly file must have separate sections for instructions and .fill directives, with the Stack section below the Data section. Global labels start with capital letters, while local labels start with lowercase letters. Undefined global labels are temporarily resolved as address 0. The object file format includes Header, Text, Data, Symbol table, and Relocation table sections. Error checking includes detecting undefined local symbolic addresses, beq using an undefined symbolic address, duplicate label definitions, oversized offsetFields, unrecognized opcodes, and illegal register operands.</p>

                            <p>This project involves graph manipulation with vertices and edges. Divided into three parts, Part A calculates a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for efficient path construction. Parts B and C focus on approximating solutions to the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) and finding optimal TSP routes, respectively. The program uses command-line options to specify modes MST, fast TSP, or optimal TSP. The project emphasizes proper command-line handling, input file formats, and graph representations. Then we output the correct distance and order for the given graph if there exists one.</p>

                            <p>This project is in fact the website you're currently on! This project has been in development for a long time. I first started by learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript in my classes SI 339 and EECS 201 at the University of Michigan. From the classes, I built my first version of the website and I tried to revamp the website and build a whole new interface, it was better, but I wasn't satisfied. Now we're at the latest version of the website which is being constantly updated. Please feel free to look around!</p>

                            <p>This project focuses on creating a pipelined simulator, emphasizing an understanding of pipelined implementations. The starter code includes necessary files and outlines specific requirements, such as implementing a cycle-accurate behavioral simulator with data forwarding and branch prediction. The project involves addressing data hazards through forwarding and, in certain cases, stalling for proper execution. Control hazards, particularly branch predictions, are also part of the implementation using predict branch-not-taken.</p>

                            <p>In the Fault Tolerance Library project, I developed a subset of a library for building fault-tolerant quantum circuits, focusing on the Steane error correction code. This included creating functions to correct single qubit errors and generate fault-tolerant circuits for various quantum gates such as X, Y, Z, H, S, T, and CNOT. My work also involved developing methods to decode measurements into logical 0 or 1, essential for ensuring the reliability of quantum computations against errors. This project not only reinforced my skills in quantum programming using Qiskit but also deepened my understanding of error correction in quantum computing, crucial for the development of scalable quantum technologies.</p>

                            <p>In a comprehensive project at the University of Michigan, my team and I developed a scalable search engine similar to Google, utilizing advanced information retrieval techniques such as tf-idf for text analysis and PageRank for link analysis. We implemented a segmented inverted index using a series of MapReduce programs, crafted a REST API for returning search results, and designed a user interface to interact with the engine. This project not only enhanced our understanding of distributed systems and Service-Oriented Architecture but also deepened our practical skills in parallel data processing and full-stack development, preparing us for real-world software engineering challenges.</p>

                            <p>The project focuses on implementing the game via priority queues and efficient algorithms. The player, armed with a bow and arrows, must strategically prioritize shooting zombies based on their distance, speed, and health to survive for as long as possible. The program takes command line options, including verbose output, statistics reporting, and median calculation. The player faces rounds of zombie attacks, with each round involving quiver refilling, zombie movement, new zombie appearances, and shooting based on priority. The project emphasizes proficiency in templated "generic" code, inheritance, polymorphism, testing, and debugging. The program reads input from standard input, which includes information about zombies, their attributes, and the game's parameters. The output includes victory or defeat messages, detailed statistics if specified, and optional verbose or median output. The project also introduces random zombie generation using PRGs for standardized random zombie generation.</p>

                            <p>In this project, I developed a C++ program to solve 3-D maze puzzles. The goal was to create a versatile solution that reads maze maps, validates their structure, and employs either breadth-first or depth-first search based on command line options to determine solvability. The program showcases effective handling of command line inputs, utilizing getopt_long(), and implements a systematic search algorithm, considering the color of the last button pressed and the player's position. It produces detailed output in list or map mode, displaying the solution path and handling cases where no solution exists. The project demonstrates my proficiency in C++ programming, algorithm implementation, and command line input handling for solving intricate maze puzzles.</p>
